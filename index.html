                <h3 class="my-3">Early life</h3>
                <p class="my-4 mx-2">Atkinson was born in Consett, County Durham, England, on 6 January 1955.[5][6][7]
                    The youngest of four boys, his parents were Eric Atkinson, a farmer and company director, and Ella
                    May (née Bainbridge), who married on 29 June 1945.[7] His three older brothers are Paul, who died as
                    an infant; Rodney, a Eurosceptic economist who narrowly lost the UK Independence Party leadership
                    election in 2000; and Rupert.[8][9]</p>
                <p class="my-4 mx-2">
                    Atkinson was brought up Anglican,[10] and was educated at Durham Choristers School, a preparatory
                    school, and then at St Bees School. Rodney, Rowan and their older brother Rupert were brought up in
                    Consett and went to school with the future Prime Minister, Tony Blair, at Durham Choristers.[11]
                    After receiving top grades in science A levels,[12] he secured a place at Newcastle University,
                    where he received a degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering.[13] In 1975, he continued for
                    the degree of MSc in Electrical Engineering at The Queen's College, Oxford, the same college where
                    his father matriculated in 1935,[14] and which made Atkinson an Honorary Fellow in 2006.[15] His MSc
                    thesis, published in 1978, considered the application of self-tuning control.[16]

                <p class="my-4 mx-2">
                    Atkinson briefly embarked in doctoral work before devoting his full attention to acting.[17] First
                    winning national attention in The Oxford Revue at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in August 1976,[13]
                    he had already written and performed sketches for shows in Oxford by the Etceteras – the revue group
                    of the Experimental Theatre Club (ETC) – and for the Oxford University Dramatic Society (OUDS),
                    meeting writer Richard Curtis,[13] and composer Howard Goodall, with whom he would continue to
                    collaborate during his career.

                        <p>Atkinson starred in a series of comedy shows for BBC Radio 3 in 1979 called The Atkinson
                            People. It consisted of a series of satirical interviews with fictional great men, who were
                            played by Atkinson himself. The series was written by Atkinson and Richard Curtis, and
                            produced by Griff Rhys Jones.[18]</p>

                        <p>After university, Atkinson did a one-off pilot for London Weekend Television in 1979 called
                            Canned Laughter. Atkinson then went on to do Not the Nine O'Clock News for the BBC, produced
                            by his friend John Lloyd. He featured in the show with Pamela Stephenson, Griff Rhys Jones
                            and Mel Smith, and was one of the main sketch writers.The success of Not the Nine O'Clock
                            News led to him taking the lead role of Edmund Blackadder in Blackadder. The first series
                            The Black Adder (1983), set in medieval period, Atkinson co-wrote with Richard Curtis. After
                            a three-year gap, in part due to budgetary concerns, a second series was broadcast, written
                            by Curtis and Ben Elton. Blackadder II (1986) followed the fortunes of one of the
                            descendants of Atkinson's original character, this time in the Elizabethan era. The same
                            pattern was repeated in the two more sequels Blackadder the Third (1987), set in the Regency
                            era, and Blackadder Goes Forth (1989), set in World War I. The Blackadder series became one
                            of the most successful of all BBC situation comedies, spawning television specials including
                            Blackadder's Christmas Carol (1988), Blackadder: The Cavalier Years (1988), and later
                            Blackadder: Back & Forth (1999), which was set at the turn of the Millennium. The final
                            scene of "Blackadder Goes Forth" (when Blackadder and his men go "over the top" and charge
                            into No-Man's-Land) has been described as "bold and highly poignant".[19] Possessing an
                            acerbic wit and armed with numerous quick put-downs (which are often wasted on those at whom
                            they are directed), in a 2001 Channel 4 poll Edmund Blackadder was ranked third (behind
                            Homer Simpson from The Simpsons and Basil Fawlty from Fawlty Towers) on their list of the
                            100 Greatest TV Characters.[20][21] During the 2014 centennial of the start of World War I,
                            Conservative Party politician Michael Gove and war historian Max Hastings complained about
                            the so-called "Blackadder version of history".</p>
                        <p>Atkinson's other creation, the hapless Mr. Bean, first appeared on New Year's Day in 1990 in
                            a half-hour special for Thames Television. The character of Mr. Bean has been likened to a
                            modern-day Buster Keaton,[26] but Atkinson himself has stated that Jacques Tati's character
                            Monsieur Hulot was the main inspiration.[27] Atkinson states, "The essence of Mr Bean is
                            that he's entirely selfish and self-centred and doesn't actually acknowledge the outside
                            world. He's a child in a man's body. Which is what most visual comedians are about: Stan
                            Laurel, Chaplin, Benny Hill."[28]

                            Several sequels to Mr. Bean appeared on television until 1995, and the character later
                            appeared in a feature film. Bean (1997) was directed by Mel Smith, Atkinson's colleague in
                            Not the Nine O'Clock News. A second film, Mr. Bean's Holiday, was released in 2007. Atkinson
                            portrayed Inspector Raymond Fowler in The Thin Blue Line (1995–96), a television sitcom
                            written by Ben Elton, which takes place in a police station located in fictitious Gasforth.

                            Atkinson has fronted campaigns for Kronenbourg,[29] Fujifilm, and Give Blood. He appeared as
                            a hapless and error-prone espionage agent named Richard Lathum in a long-running series of
                            adverts for Barclaycard, on which character his title role in Johnny English, Johnny English
                            Reborn and Johnny English Strikes Again was based. In 1999, he played the Doctor in The
                            Curse of Fatal Death, a special Doctor Who serial produced for the charity telethon Comic
                            Relief.[30] Atkinson appeared as the Star in a Reasonably Priced Car on the BBC's Top Gear
                            in July 2011, driving the Kia Cee'd around the track in 1:42.2. Placing him at the top of
                            the leaderboard, his lap time was significantly quicker than the previous high-profile
                            record holder Tom Cruise, whose time was a 1:44.2.</p>

                        <p>Atkinson's film career began with a supporting part in the "unofficial" James Bond movie
                            Never Say Never Again (1983) and a leading role in Dead on Time (also 1983) with Nigel
                            Hawthorne. He was in the 1988 Oscar-winning short film The Appointments of Dennis Jennings.
                            He appeared in Mel Smith's directorial debut The Tall Guy (1989) and appeared alongside
                            Anjelica Huston and Mai Zetterling in The Witches (1990), a film adaptation of the Roald
                            Dahl children's novel. He played the part of Dexter Hayman in Hot Shots! Part Deux (1993), a
                            parody of Rambo III, starring Charlie Sheen.

                            Atkinson gained further recognition as a verbally bumbling vicar in Four Weddings and a
                            Funeral (1994, written and directed by his long time collaborator Richard Curtis), and
                            featured in Disney's The Lion King (also 1994) as the voice of Zazu the red-billed hornbill.
                            He also sang the song "I Just Can't Wait to Be King" in The Lion King. Atkinson continued to
                            appear in supporting roles in comedies, including Rat Race (2001), Scooby-Doo (2002),
                            jewellery salesman Rufus in another Richard Curtis British-set romantic comedy, Love
                            Actually (2003), and the crime comedy Keeping Mum (2005), which also starred Kristin Scott
                            Thomas, Maggie Smith, and Patrick Swayze.

                            In addition to his supporting roles, Atkinson has also had success as a leading man. His
                            television character Mr. Bean debuted on the big screen with Bean (1997) to international
                            success. A sequel, Mr. Bean's Holiday (2007), (again inspired to some extent by Jacques Tati
                            in his film Les Vacances de Monsieur Hulot), also became an international success. He has
                            also starred in the James Bond parody Johnny English film series (2003–2018).[46]</p>
